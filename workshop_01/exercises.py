# ============================================
#   WORKSHOP 1: Hello Python + Your Game!
# ============================================
# 
# Your Name: ______________________
# Date: ______________________
#
# ============================================


# ========================================
# EXERCISE 1: Your First Print Statements
# ========================================

# This is an example - run it to see what happens!
print("Hello, world!")

#  YOUR TURN: Print "I love coding!"


#  YOUR TURN: Print your name (example: "My name is Pooja")



# ========================================
# EXERCISE 2: Printing Numbers and Math
# ========================================

# Python can do math! No quotes needed for numbers.
print(5 + 3)
print(10 * 7)

#  YOUR TURN: Print 100 divided by 4


# YOUR TURN: Print 2 to the power of 10 (hint: use **)



# ========================================
# EXERCISE 3: Mixing Text and Numbers
# ========================================

# Use commas to print multiple things together!
print("My favorite number is", 7)
print("Five plus three equals", 5 + 3)

#  YOUR TURN: Print "My age is" followed by your age


#  YOUR TURN: Print "There are ___ seconds in a minute" with the number



# ========================================
# EXERCISE 4: Comments
# ========================================

# Lines starting with # are comments - Python ignores them!
# Comments are notes for humans to understand the code.

print("This line runs!")  # Comments can go at the end too
# print("This line is commented out - it won't run!")

#  YOUR TURN: Write a comment explaining what this code does:

print("Python is awesome!")

#  YOUR TURN: Comment out the line below so it doesn't run:
print("You should not see this message!")



# ========================================
# EXERCISE 5: Common Mistakes (Fix These!)
# ========================================

# Each line below has an error. Fix them!
# (Remove the # to uncomment, then fix the error)

# Mistake 1: Missing quotes around text
# print(Hello there!)

# Mistake 2: Wrong capitalization
# Print("Hello")

# Mistake 3: Mismatched quotes  
# print("Hello')



# ========================================
# EXERCISE 6: ASCII Art
# ========================================

# You can draw pictures with text characters!
# Here's a simple house:

print("   /\\")
print("  /  \\")
print(" /____\\")
print(" |    |")
print(" | [] |")
print(" |____|")

#  YOUR TURN: Create your own ASCII art!
# Ideas: rocket ship, smiley face, your initials, a star
# 
# Hint: Use characters like / \ | _ - * # @ ^




# ========================================
# 🎮 GAME TASK: Customize Your Game!
# ========================================

# STEP 1: Open game_project/settings.py
# 
# STEP 2: Find GAME_TITLE and change it to YOUR game's name
#         Example: GAME_TITLE = "Galaxy Defender"
#
# STEP 3: Find MY_COLOR and make your own color!
#         Colors use (Red, Green, Blue) from 0-255
#         Example: MY_COLOR = (255, 100, 50)  # Orange-ish
#
# STEP 4: Find PLAYER_COLOR and change it to MY_COLOR
#         PLAYER_COLOR = MY_COLOR
#
# STEP 5: Run game_project/game.py and see YOUR game!

# Write down what you changed:
# My game title: ______________________
# My color RGB values: (_____, _____, _____)



# ========================================
#  GAME TASK: Welcome Screen
# ========================================

# Create a welcome message for your game!
# Use print() to display:
# - Your game's title (make it look cool!)
# - A short story or description
# - Maybe some ASCII art?

print()  # Blank line
print("=" * 40)

# YOUR CODE HERE - Create your welcome screen!




print("=" * 40)



# ========================================
# BONUS CHALLENGES (if you finish early!)
# ========================================

# Challenge 1: Calculate how many seconds are in a day
# (60 seconds × 60 minutes × 24 hours)
# print("Seconds in a day:", ???)


# Challenge 2: Create a rocket ship with ASCII art
# Make it at least 5 lines tall!


# Challenge 3: Print a 5-line story for your game
# What's the plot? Why is the player fighting aliens?
